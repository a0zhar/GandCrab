## The v5.0 (JS-Dropper) Directory

This directory contains files related to the JS-based Ransomware-Binary Dropper used by GandCrab v5 to spread. These files have been somewhat deobfuscated and modified by me to attempt to make them easier to understand and work with.

## The v5.1 (Webpage) Directory

This directory contains files modified by me, which were dropped on a GandCrab v5.1 infected system. This webpage, from my observation, serves as a file recovery help page that victims could use as a guide.
